<p>Intelligent systems are widely used in our industrial and economic world, such as intelligent transportation systems and smart factories, which have brought a lot of convenience to our lives, but the design of cyber-physical systems is still a very difficult task and requires more researchers' efforts. The problems to be solved urgently in cyber-physical system design mainly include lack of  trustable monitoring tools, lack of safe  guarantees   and lack of interpretable algorithms.</p>

    The inherent and increasing complexity of many cyber-physical systems (CPSs) makes it challenging for human users or designers to comprehend and interpret their performance. This issue, without proper attention paid, may lead to unwanted and even catastrophic consequences, particularly with safety-critical CPSs.  Formal languages can be used to describe the behavious of CPSs in an interpretable way.  However, traditional formal languages cannot deal with noisy environments. Additionally, finding the optimal formal language for CPS is still a challenge due to the sparse   reward issue.    This research direction tries  to find  formal languages to describe the   behaviours of CPS.  The formal language defined   is robust to noise, acts as the classifier or prognoiser, and provides interpretabilities for human operators. Moreover, the learned formal lanugae can be applied to other applicaiton, such as CPS design, guiding learning direction in neural networks.   </p>
