<p><b>Fundamental challenges: </b> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are widely used in our industrial and economic world, such as intelligent transportation systems and smart factories, which have brought a lot of convenience to our lives, but the design of cyber-physical systems is still a very difficult task and requires more researchers' efforts. The problems to be solved urgently in cyber-physical system design mainly include lack of   high level knwledge, difficulty in verification, and lack of efficient algorithms.</p>
<li><b>Lack of   high level knwledge:</b> In traditional formal methods, human experts can use linear temporal logic (LTL)  and its variants, e.g., computation tree logic (CTL), signal temporal logic (STL), and metric temporal logic (MTL), to mathematically explain what the system is supposed to do and then such high level knwledge can be checked against the behaviours of the system. However, as CPS are becoming increasingly complex (e.g., many CPS are equipped with artificial intelligence- and/or machine-learning-based components), it is quite challenging to come up with a high-quality high level knwledge even for domain experts (actually such a challenge is well known even for application domains in which formal methods have found considerable success). </li>
 <li><b>Difficulty in verification:</b>CPS usually are combination of many subsystems. The verification of such systems will come across state space explosion problem, making the application of standard verification approaches substantially less effective.  The lack of verifiability causes safety and security concerns, hence it is imperative to build cost-effective tools to verify such systems.</li>

    The inherent and increasing complexity of many cyber-physical systems (CPSs) makes it challenging for human users or designers to comprehend and interpret their performance. This issue, without proper attention paid, may lead to unwanted and even catastrophic consequences, particularly with safety-critical CPSs.  Formal languages can be used to describe the behavious of CPSs in an interpretable way.  However, traditional formal languages cannot deal with noisy environments. Additionally, finding the optimal formal language for CPS is still a challenge due to the sparse   reward issue.    This research direction tries  to find  formal languages to describe the   behaviours of CPS.  The formal language defined   is robust to noise, acts as the classifier or prognoiser, and provides interpretabilities for human operators. Moreover, the learned formal lanugae can be applied to other applicaiton, such as CPS design, guiding learning direction in neural networks.   </p>
